        <p>Online school statrts in about 14 days and I still haven't made a decision. Covid-19 has made other kids transfer, but it is not about corona for me. For me, it is about making the right decision and in person school may not be the correct answer for me. Last year, my junior year, I was going through  tough time and when we all never went back to school, that was actually great for me. I will probably do online school, I do not want to be sad again trying to fit into a group that will never accept me for who I am. </p>

        <p>Online school was basically the best decision I could have made for myself. I am a few months in and I love it. The teachers are amazing, the schedule is good, and asking for help has never been better. I actually don't know why I didn't transfer sooner. Although, if i had then I really wouldn't know anyone and having my one best friend do online with me has been a lot better. Thank you to the pandemic for making my senior year better than most other years. </p>
